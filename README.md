- **Query Language:** SQL

  
## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

### 2. Schemas Setup
- **Database Creation:** The project begins with setting up a database named `netflix_db`.  
- **Table Creation:** Create all neccesary table to store required data.
  
```sql
-- CREATING TABLE 

CREATE TABLE Netflix 
	(
	show_id	VARCHAR (10),
	type VARCHAR (15),
	title VARCHAR (500),
	director VARCHAR (500),
	casts VARCHAR (1000),
	country	VARCHAR (1000),
	date_added DATE,
	release_year INT,
	rating VARCHAR (10),
	duration VARCHAR (30),
	listed_in VARCHAR (500),
	description VARCHAR (1000)
	);

SELECT * FROM netflix

-- Changing Column "date_added" to VARCHAR from data_type DATE
	
ALTER TABLE netflix
ALTER COLUMN date_added TYPE VARCHAR(20)
USING date_added::VARCHAR;

-- Updating Character Length in table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Netflix;
CREATE TABLE Netflix 
	(
	show_id	VARCHAR (10),
	type VARCHAR (15),
	title VARCHAR (500),
	director VARCHAR (500),
	casts VARCHAR (1000),
	country	VARCHAR (1000),
	date_added DATE,
	release_year INT,
	rating VARCHAR (10),
	duration VARCHAR (30),
	listed_in VARCHAR (500),
	description VARCHAR (1000)
	);

SELECT * FROM netflix

-- Verifying Data

SELECT COUNT (*) total_count 
	FROM netflix;

SELECT DISTINCT type 
FROM Netflix;
```
## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows
Objective: Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```
### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows
**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
### 3. List All Movies Released in 2020

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix 
WHERE release_year = '2020'
```
### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

FROM(
	SELECT 
        TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content,
		RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) country_rank
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1) sub
WHERE country_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 5
```
### 5. Identify the Longest Movie
```sql
SELECT title,
	duration
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```
### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE date_added >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 year';
```
### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        *,

    FROM netflix
) AS t
WHERE director_name = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```
### 8. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT > 5;
```

### 9. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

```sql
SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ','))) genre, 
	COUNT (*) genre_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
```
### 10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. 
**Objective:** Return top 5 year with highest avg content release!

```sql
SELECT 
	release_date,
	average
FROM( 
	SELECT *,
		RANK () OVER (ORDER BY average DESC) year_rank
	FROM (
		SELECT
			EXTRACT (Year FROM date_added) release_date,
			COUNT (*) movie_count,
			ROUND(COUNT (*)::numeric/(SELECT COUNT (*)
								FROM netflix 
								WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 0) average
		FROM netflix
		WHERE country = 'India'
		GROUP BY 1
		)sub
	)sub2
WHERE year_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY average DESC
```
### 11. List All Movies that are Documentaries

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix

```sql
SELECT casts AS actors,
	actors_count

	COUNT (*) actors_count,
	RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC) actors_rank
FROM (
		SELECT * 
		FROM netflix
		WHERE country = 'India'
	)sub
GROUP BY 1)sub2
WHERE actors_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 10
```

### 15. Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords
